      "[Document(page_content=\"May 2021Noora Health, a nonprofit I've supported for years, just launched a new NFT. It has a dramatic name, Save Thousands of Lives, because that's what the proceeds will do.Noora has been saving lives for 7 years. They run programs in hospitals in South Asia to teach new mothers how to take care of their babies once they get home. They're in 165 hospitals now. And because they know the numbers before and after they start at a new hospital, they can measure the impact they have. It is massive. For every 1000 live births, they save 9 babies.This number comes from a study of 133,733 families at 28 different hospitals that Noora conducted in collaboration with the Better Birth team at Ariadne Labs, a joint center for health systems innovation at Brigham and WomenÂ’s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the most conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number of lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen. $1,235.For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how this specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number of lives saved as a result.NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially new, but I'm excited about its potential. And I'm excited to see what happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT representing something that has already happened, this NFT gets better as the price gets higher.The reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that's what it takes for the name to be accurate: that's what it costs to save 2000 lives. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more lives will be saved.

People who would never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.If you want to try working on unfashionable problems, one of the best places to look is in fields that people think have already been fully explored: essays, Lisp, venture funding Â— you may notice a pattern here. If you can find a new approach into a big but apparently played out field, the value of whatever you discover will be multiplied by its enormous surface area.The best protection against getting drawn into working on the same things as everyone else may be to genuinely love what you're doing.

Her list seems plausible.  I could see myself — can see myself — making at least 4 of these 5 mistakes.If you had to compress them into a single piece of advice, it might be: don't be a cog.  The 5 regrets paint a portrait of post-industrial man, who shrinks himself into a shape that fits his circumstances, then turns dutifully till he stops.The alarming thing is, the mistakes that produce these regrets are all errors of omission.  You forget your dreams, ignore your family, suppress your feelings, neglect your friends, and forget to be happy.  Errors of omission are a particularly dangerous type of mistake, because you make them by default.I would like to avoid making these mistakes.  But how do you avoid mistakes you make by default?  Ideally you transform your life so it has other defaults.  But it may not be possible to do that completely. As long as these mistakes happen by default, you probably have to be reminded not to make them.  So I inverted the 5 regrets, yielding a list of 5 commands\\n\\nDon't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.\\n\\nwhich I then put at the top of the file I use as a todo list.\", metadata={'source': '../data/PaulGrahamEssaySmall/todo.txt'}), Document(page_content='April 2020I recently saw a video of TV journalists and politicians confidently saying that the coronavirus would be no worse than the flu. What struck me about it was not just how mistaken they seemed, but how daring. How could they feel safe saying such things?The answer, I realized, is that they didn\\'t think they could get caught. They didn\\'t realize there was any danger in making false predictions. These people constantly make false predictions, and get away with it, because the things they make predictions about either have mushy enough outcomes that they can bluster their way out of trouble, or happen so far in the future that few remember what they said.An epidemic is different. It falsifies your predictions rapidly and unequivocally.But epidemics are rare enough that these people clearly didn\\'t realize this was even a possibility. Instead they just continued to use their ordinary m.o., which, as the epidemic has made clear, is to talk confidently about things they don\\'t understand.An event like this is thus a uniquely powerful way of taking people\\'s measure. As Warren Buffett said, \"It\\'s only when the tide goes out that you learn who\\'s been swimming naked.\" And the tide has just gone out like never before.Now that we\\'ve seen the results, let\\'s remember what we saw, because this is the most accurate test of credibility we\\'re ever likely to have.

You don\\'t need to know this stuff to program in Lisp, but it should be helpful to anyone who wants to understand the essence of Lisp \\x97 both in the sense of its origins and its semantic core.  The fact that it has such a core is one of Lisp\\'s distinguishing features, and the reason why, unlike other languages, Lisp has dialects.)In 1960, John McCarthy published a remarkable paper in which he did for programming something like what Euclid did for geometry. He showed how, given a handful of simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole programming language. He called this language Lisp, for \"List Processing,\" because one of his key ideas was to use a simple data structure called a list for both code and data.It\\'s worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as a model for what programming is tending to become in our own time.  It seems to me that there have been two really clean, consistent models of programming so far: the C model and the Lisp model. These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands between them.  As computers have grown more powerful, the new languages being developed have been moving steadily toward the Lisp model.  A popular recipe for new programming languages in the past 20 years has been to take the C model of computing and add to it, piecemeal, parts taken from the Lisp model, like runtime typing and garbage collection.In this article I\\'m going to try to explain in the simplest possible terms what McCarthy discovered. The point is not just to learn about an interesting theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago, but to show where languages are heading.

The fact that it has such a core is one of Lisp\\'s distinguishing features, and the reason why, unlike other languages, Lisp has dialects.)In 1960, John McCarthy published a remarkable paper in which he did for programming something like what Euclid did for geometry. He showed how, given a handful of simple operators and a notation for functions, you can build a whole programming language. He called this language Lisp, for \"List Processing,\" because one of his key ideas was to use a simple data structure called a list for both code and data.It\\'s worth understanding what McCarthy discovered, not just as a landmark in the history of computers, but as a model for what programming is tending to become in our own time.', metadata={'source': '../data/PaulGrahamEssaySmall/rootsoflisp.txt'}),\n",

These two seem points of high ground, with swampy lowlands between them.  As computers have grown more powerful, the new languages being developed have been moving steadily toward the Lisp model.  A popular recipe for new programming languages in the past 20 years has been to take the C model of computing and add to it, piecemeal, parts taken from the Lisp model, like runtime typing and garbage collection.In this article I'm going to try to explain in the simplest possible terms what McCarthy discovered. The point is not just to learn about an interesting theoretical result someone figured out forty years ago, but to show where languages are heading.

One common way for a good idea to be non-obvious is for it to be hidden in the shadow of some mistaken assumption that people are very attached to. But anything you discover from working on such an idea will tend to contradict the mistaken assumption that was concealing it.  And you will thus get a lot of heat from people attached to the mistaken assumption. Galileo and Darwin are famous examples of this phenomenon, but it's probably always an ingredient in the resistance to new ideas.So it's particularly dangerous for an organization or society to have a culture of pouncing on heresy.
